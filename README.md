# Drinks-Python-Data-Analysis


## Introduction :

This Project is about 193 countries and 5 continents and their various types of alcoholic-drink consumptions like beer, wine, spirit and alcohol. A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer, wine and cocktails, but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume. In this data the drink types are beers, spirit, wine and alcohol. Beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches from cereal grains most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize, rice, and oats are also used. An alcoholic beverage is a beverage containing alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are typically divided into three classes—beers, wines, and spirits—and typically their alcohol content is between 3% and 50%. Beer is one of the oldest alcoholic drinks in the world, the most widely consumed, and the third most popular drink after water and tea. Spirit or distilled beverage is an alcoholic drink produced by the distillation of grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. Spirit generally has an alcohol concentration higher than 30% when bottled, and before being diluted for bottling, it typically has a concentration over 50%. Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented fruit. Yeast consumes the sugar in the fruit and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Wine is most often made from grapes, and the term "wine" generally refers to grape wine when used without any qualification. Wine has been produced for thousands of years. In this data analysis of Python we will talk about these elements only.

## This Project includes :

- **Import Libraries :** The first step to import libraries that are required like NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas by writing code.
- **Load Dataset :** Loaded TMDB Dataset through pandas read csv code.
- **Data Analysis :** Calculated total no. of countries and continents and various other information.
- **Data Interpretation :** Drag various qualitative information through interpreting data.
- **Data Visualization :** Through Seaborn library, constructed various visuals for clear understanding.

## Conclusion :

The global alcoholic drinks market size was valued at USD 1,448.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10.3% from 2022 to 2028. This can be credited to the growing consumption of premium beer from developed economies. The growing demand for beer, wine, and dark spirits is enhancing the sales of alcoholic beverages. From the above analysis we can conclude that there are total 193 countries and 5 continents in the dataset under which out of this 193 countries, beer consumption is popular in Namibia country which is in Southern Africa, wine consumption is famous in France country which is in Europe, spirit consumption is mostly consumed in Grenada country which is in Caribbean and pure alcohol is famous in Belarus country which is in Europe. In this Dataset out of 5 continents Europe is the top most consumer of the beverages and has highest contribution in the worldwide alcoholic drink market.
